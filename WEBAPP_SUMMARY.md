# WebApp Summary

## Application Overview

This application is an encrypted peer-to-peer messenger. It uses the following technologies:

- **React:** For the user interface.
- **PeerJS:** To facilitate WebRTC connections between users, enabling direct peer-to-peer communication without a central server for message relay.
- **CryptoJS:** For AES encryption and decryption of messages, using the shared secret generated by `AlbertCrypto`.
- **Custom Cryptography (`AlbertCrypto`):** A custom implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to generate a shared secret between users for end-to-end encryption.

## Peer Encryption: A Topological and Matrix Perspective

The core of the application's security lies in the `AlbertCrypto` module, which implements the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This process can be understood through the lens of topology and matrix transformations, providing a unique way to visualize how two peers establish a shared secret over a public network.

### 1. The Public Space and Private Transformations (Topology)

Imagine the network as a vast, open topological space. Within this space, we have a publicly agreed-upon starting point, or "generator" (`g`), and a set of rules for movement defined by a large prime modulus (`p`). These elements, defined in `AlbertCrypto`, create a finite cyclic group.

- **Private Key:** Each user generates a secret, large integer known as the private key (`a` for Alice, `b` for Bob). This number is kept completely private and represents a secret "transformation" or "twist" that only they know how to perform.

- **Public Key:** The user applies their private transformation to the public generator `g`. The result (`A = g^a mod p`) is their public key. This public key is a new point in the topological space. It is mathematically derived from the private key, but it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and find the private key (this is known as the Discrete Logarithm Problem). This new point is then shared publicly.

### 2. Converging on a Shared Secret

When two peers wish to communicate, they exchange their public keys (`A` and `B`) over the insecure network. Now, a fascinating topological convergence occurs:

- Alice takes Bob's public key (`B`) and applies her own private transformation (`a`) to it. This action navigates her from point `B` to a new, secret point `S = B^a mod p`.
- Bob simultaneously takes Alice's public key (`A`) and applies his private transformation (`b`) to it. This navigates him from point `A` to a new, secret point `S = A^b mod p`.

Due to the properties of modular arithmetic, both peers arrive at the exact same secret point `S`, even though they started from different points (`A` and `B`) and applied different transformations (`b` and `a`).

- Alice's calculation: `S = (g^b)^a mod p = g^(b*a) mod p`
- Bob's calculation: `S = (g^a)^b mod p = g^(a*b) mod p`

This shared secret point `S` is their shared secret key. It was never transmitted over the network. Instead, both peers were guided to it through a mathematical convergence that is invisible to any observer who does not possess one of the private keys.

### 3. A Matrix State Representation

While not a direct matrix multiplication, the process can be conceptualized using state vectors and transformation operators.

Consider the state of each peer as a vector containing their private and the other's public key:
- Alice's State Vector: `V_A = [private_key_a, public_key_B]`
- Bob's State Vector: `V_B = [private_key_b, public_key_A]`

A non-linear transformation operator `T(base, exponent) = base^exponent mod p` is used to compute the shared secret.

- `SharedSecret = T(V_A[1], V_A[0]) = T(V_B[1], V_B[0])`

This demonstrates the symmetric nature of the key exchange. Both peers apply the same transformation to their respective state vectors, yielding an identical scalar result. This final scalar is used as the key for AES encryption (via CryptoJS) to secure all subsequent messages.

## "Free Limit" Issue

The "free limit" you are encountering is most likely related to the public PeerJS signaling server. While PeerJS connections are peer-to-peer, a signaling server is required to broker the initial connection between two peers. The public server provided by PeerJS is free to use for development and testing, but it has usage limits to prevent abuse.

To resolve this, you can host your own PeerJS server. This will give you full control over the signaling process and remove any limitations imposed by the public server. You can find instructions on how to set up your own PeerJS server in the PeerJS documentation.
